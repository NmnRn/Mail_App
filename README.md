---

## 📌 Prerequisites

This project uses the **Gmail API**, which requires **Google Cloud OAuth** configuration.

Before running the application, you **must read and follow the official Gmail API Quickstart guide**:

👉 **Google Gmail API Quickstart (Python)**  
https://developers.google.com/workspace/gmail/api/quickstart/python?hl=tr

This guide explains how to:
- Enable the Gmail API  
- Configure OAuth consent and credentials  
- Create the `credentials.json` file  
- Generate the initial `token.json`

---

## ⚠️ First Run – Common Error (`credentials.json`)

If you run the project for the first time and see the following error:

```text
FileNotFoundError: No such file or directory: 'credentials.json'
This is expected behavior.

Why does this happen?
The Gmail API requires OAuth authentication

The credentials.json file is generated by Google Cloud Console

For security reasons, this file is not included in the repository

First-time users do not have this file yet

👉 This is not a bug, but a missing setup step.

✅ How to Fix
Follow the official Gmail API Quickstart:
https://developers.google.com/workspace/gmail/api/quickstart/python

Create a Google Cloud project and enable Gmail API

Create an OAuth 2.0 Client ID

Download the generated credentials.json

Place credentials.json in the project root directory

After that, run the application again.

▶️ How to Run
bash
python app.py
On the first successful run:

Your browser will open for Google login

OAuth consent will be requested

Tokens/token.json will be created automatically
